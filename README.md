# Forkify - Recipe Application

A modern web application for searching, viewing, and saving recipes. Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## About The Project

This project was created as part of "The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!" course taught by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. During the course, I was guided through the development of this application, which allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of modern web development techniques. Although this project was built based on the course, my goal was to fully understand its functionality, and now I would be able to build a similar application on my own.

## Features

- Search for over 1,000,000 recipes
- View recipe details including cooking time and ingredients
- Bookmark favorite recipes
- Adjust servings based on your needs
- Upload your own recipes
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Technologies Used

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3 with BEM methodology
- Parcel (Bundler)
- Netlify (Hosting)

## How It Works

The application uses the Forkify API to fetch recipe data. The modern JavaScript architecture follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for clean code organization. All data is persisted using the browser's local storage.

To run locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
